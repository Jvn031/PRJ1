    <h2> HERE'S MY STORY</h2>
    <div class="STORY_CONTENT">
        <p>
I am a 17-year-old student originally from The Philippines, currently living in Canada.

Having recently moved to this diverse and welcoming country, I am excited to embrace new challenges and opportunities as I pursue my education here.

I developed a passion for coding when I was in grade 9, and I am excited to continue honing my skills in this field. Alongside coding, I also enjoy staying active and creative through my hobbies. Badminton is one of my favorite ways to stay fit and socialize, while cooking allows me to blend flavors from my cultural background with new ingredients I’ve discovered in Canada. Music is another important part of my life, and I love exploring different genres and occasionally playing Acoustic Guitar while Singing.

Although adjusting to a new culture, climate, and school system has been a challenge, I remain dedicated to my studies and improving my English language skills. I’m eager to contribute my unique background and experiences to the school community while continuing to grow personally, academically, and in my passion for coding.
